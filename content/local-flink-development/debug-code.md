In addition to simply executing the Flink application, you can also set breakpoints and debug the application locally, which is very convenient when implementing and verifying the business logic.

1. Expand the utils package and navigate to and double click the `GeoUtils` class

1. Set a breakpoint by clicking left of a code line, eg, Line 35

1. Ensure you have stopped the flink program execution started in previous section. Press the red square button or press Ctrl + F2 (On Mac : Ctrl + Fn + F2)

1. Start the debugging process by clicking the green bug next in the upper right corner of the IDE
